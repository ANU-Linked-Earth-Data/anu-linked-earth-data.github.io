This is the client application. Currently it's using a AngularJS and Bootstrap
to display information from Sam's Nectar server. To run the app, use

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ xdg-open http://localhost:8000/app/
```

Project structure is the same used as that used by
[`angular-seed`](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed).
